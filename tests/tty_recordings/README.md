# What are these files

They are terminal recordings made by the `ttyrec` command which can be
played back with the `ttyplay` command.

# Is there a file naming convention?

Yes! There should be two file name extensions:

* the first one is the terminal size that made the recording (ROWSxCOLS).
* The second should be `ttyrec`.

Anything before the extensions is descriptive.
