Client Server Work
==================

* [ ] implement server ProgramStart handler
* [ ] implement debug for ClientMsg and ServerMsg
* [ ] Use a different enum to communicate between
  client::stdin\_read\_worker and client::input\_worker. DRY with
  VteWorkerMsg stuff.
* [ ] implement a mode
* [ ] use cap'n proto instead of channel to communicate between client
      and server
