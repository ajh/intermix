# Design approach

For now, I'm just going to list the operations I need, then sort them
into mode groups as best I can.

Modes are a client concept. They don't exist on the server.

# Commands

* keys to go a program
* navigate through programs, up / down / select
* pane mgmt - navigate through panes, close them
* window mgmt - open new window, navigate through windows left right,
  select window
